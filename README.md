**Description**
The aim of this app is to improve the user experience and decrease the time spent while shopping online. We have built an adaptive and interactive Android-based virtual salesman application which will try to address this concern. The agent will be able to assist the user while shopping and will filter the options based on user’s requirements to show a focused list of products for the user to choose from.
